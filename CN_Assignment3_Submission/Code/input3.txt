IUCEE has the mission of creating an ecosystem for improving the quality of engineering education in India. Engineering graduates need to have the attributes of a global engineer. A major dimension missing from the formal engineering education around the world is the ability to teach engineering graduates to identify problems, to work in teams and use design thinking to find real solutions to industry or societal challenges. These characteristics are embedded in the criteria of all accreditation agencies around the world. IUCEE has been working in developing an ecosystem with focus on student-centered teaching strategies and project based learning approaches in order to address these needs.
Engineers Without Borders (EWB) has the mission of building a better world through engineering projects that empower communities to meet their basic human needs. Volunteers work with communities to find appropriate solutions for their infrastructure needs. EWB India has been successfully working on relevant projects all over India for the past several years.
The synergy between the two organizations is obvious. Engineering students working on EWB India projects in their communities, mentored by industry professionals as well as by trained faculty will acquire the skills of leadership, employability and entrepreneurship needed by the world today. With this in mind, IUCEE has piloted a Student Leadership Course in Fall 2019 and followed it up with an IUCEE Annual Student Forum in partnership with EWB India in January 2020. The Annual Conference of EWB India immediately followed the IUCEE Student Forum. Below is a summary of both these and a proposal for moving forward in 2020. 

IASF (IUCEE Annual Student Forum) 2020 was conducted at Anurag Group of Institutions, Hyderabad from Jan 4 to 7, 2020, in parallel with the Annual Conference of IUCEE (ICTIEE 2020).
The overall objective was to provide an opportunity for engineering students in India to develop leadership skills and participate in designing innovative solutions to the grand challenges being faced in their communities. The focus was on four tracks: Sanitation, Alternate Energy, Air Pollution and Education Augmentation.
189 students representing 24 institutions from TS, AP, TN, KN, KL, RJ, and MH participated. Most of these students were from IUCEE institutions. Several were from newly formed EWB India Chapters.
Ravi Talluri, Management Consultant and an industry veteran with 25 years of international and national exposure coordinated with whole program with the help of Prof. Ishrat Mirzana from MJCET (Mufakkam Jah College of Engineering and Technology). Both are veterans of EWB India.
 
A workshop on “Creativity and Design Thinking” was conducted on the first day. On the second day teams began relevant research with focus on understanding of the problem and what solutions have been implemented in the past. Teams developed action plans on how to interact with the community and identify and implement innovative and relevant solutions. On the third day, teams made presentations which were evaluated by judges.

189 students representing 24 institutions from TS, AP, TN, KN, KL, RJ, and MH participated. Most of these students were from IUCEE institutions. Several were from newly formed EWB India Chapters.
Ravi Talluri, Management Consultant and an industry veteran with 25 years of international and national exposure coordinated with whole program with the help of Prof. Ishrat Mirzana from MJCET (Mufakkam Jah College of Engineering and Technology). Both are veterans of EWB India.
 
A workshop on “Creativity and Design Thinking” was conducted on the first day. On the second day teams began relevant research with focus on understanding of the problem and what solutions have been implemented in the past. Teams developed action plans on how to interact with the community and identify and implement innovative and relevant solutions. On the third day, teams made presentations which were evaluated by judges.


Synergies in Missions:
IUCEE has the mission of creating an ecosystem for improving the quality of engineering education in India. Engineering graduates need to have the attributes of a global engineer. A major dimension missing from the formal engineering education around the world is the ability to teach engineering graduates to identify problems, to work in teams and use design thinking to find real solutions to industry or societal challenges. These characteristics are embedded in the criteria of all accreditation agencies around the world. IUCEE has been working in developing an ecosystem with focus on student-centered teaching strategies and project based learning approaches in order to address these needs.
Engineers Without Borders (EWB) has the mission of building a better world through engineering projects that empower communities to meet their basic human needs. Volunteers work with communities to find appropriate solutions for their infrastructure needs. EWB India has been successfully working on relevant projects all over India for the past several years.
The synergy between the two organizations is obvious. Engineering students working on EWB India projects in their communities, mentored by industry professionals as well as by trained faculty will acquire the skills of leadership, employability and entrepreneurship needed by the world today. With this in mind, IUCEE has piloted a Student Leadership Course in Fall 2019 and followed it up with an IUCEE Annual Student Forum in partnership with EWB India in January 2020. The Annual Conference of EWB India immediately followed the IUCEE Student Forum. Below is a summary of both these and a proposal for moving forward in 2020. 

IASF (IUCEE Annual Student Forum) 2020 was conducted at Anurag Group of Institutions, Hyderabad from Jan 4 to 7, 2020, in parallel with the Annual Conference of IUCEE (ICTIEE 2020).

Volunteers work with communities to find appropriate solutions for their infrastructure needs. EWB India has been successfully working on relevant projects all over India for the past several years.
The synergy between the two organizations is obvious. Engineering students working on EWB India projects in their communities, mentored by industry professionals as well as by trained faculty will acquire the skills of leadership, employability and entrepreneurship needed by the world today. With this in mind, IUCEE has piloted a Student Leadership Course in Fall 2019 and followed it up with an IUCEE Annual Student Forum in partnership with EWB India in January 2020. The Annual Conference of EWB India immediately followed the IUCEE Student Forum. Below is a summary of both these and a proposal for moving forward in 2020. 

IASF (IUCEE Annual Student Forum) 2020 was conducted at Anurag Group of Institutions, Hyderabad from Jan 4 to 7, 2020, in parallel with the Annual Conference of IUCEE (ICTIEE 2020).
The overall objective was to provide an opportunity for engineering students in India to develop leadership skills and participate in designing innovative solutions to the grand challenges being faced in their communities. The focus was on four tracks: Sanitation, Alternate Energy, Air Pollution and Education Augmentation.
189 students representing 24 institutions from TS, AP, TN, KN, KL, RJ, and MH participated. Most of these students were from IUCEE institutions. Several were from newly formed EWB India Chapters.
Ravi Talluri, Management Consultant and an industry veteran with 25 years of international and national exposure coordinated with whole program with the help of Prof. Ishrat Mirzana from MJCET (Mufakkam Jah College of Engineering and Technology). Both are veterans of EWB India.
 
A workshop on “Creativity and Design Thinking” was conducted on the first day. On the second day teams began relevant research with focus on understanding of the problem and what solutions have been implemented in the past. Teams developed action plans on how to interact with the community and identify and implement innovative and relevant solutions. On the third day, teams made presentations which were evaluated by judges.

IUCEE has the mission of creating an ecosystem for improving the quality of engineering education in India. Engineering graduates need to have the attributes of a global engineer. A major dimension missing from the formal engineering education around the world is the ability to teach engineering graduates to identify problems, to work in teams and use design thinking to find real solutions to industry or societal challenges. These characteristics are embedded in the criteria of all accreditation agencies around the world.
